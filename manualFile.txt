This is a manual file.  I'm working on the process of adding and pushing this file to get.
This is now an edit of the manual file.  What will the VS Code status be?

The VS code source control change to show a modified file by adding symbol "M".
crtl + shift + G allows me to graphically add the changes.
it seems the commit must be made from the command line.
another ctrl + shift + g allows a push.

I think I like the command line better for the push.  I'll keep practicing.
